# Welp

So everything I have ever found on golang best practices says not to do this. However, fuck that. I like folders. So now we have this clusterfuck of folders.
It's so I can have all my commands in one folder but split into seperate files based on what the command does without getting import loops and sharing memory. Enjoy.
