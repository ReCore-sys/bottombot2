# Random Ideas I had regarding combat system

- Armour with actual sprites
- A map image with the player on it
- Enemies drop items and money
- You have a health system
- Whole thing is a shitpost and you are fighting enemies like "League of Legends Player", "British 'person'", ect.
- Weapons have names like "Horny bonker", "Bluetooth hose", shit like that
- You can run away from fights, but they will always get a free hit in and have a chance to either chase you deal more damage
- You can sell items
- Leveling system of course
- The bot can create a #weaponsmith channel where you can buy weapons and upgrade your existing ones
- Have the items and enemies be in a .json file that gets reloaded every time the file is modified so I can add new items and enemies without having to restart the bot
